# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is CallingClaw

Real-time voice AI for meetings. Joins Google Meet/Zoom as a participant, listens, speaks, takes notes, and controls the computer. macOS only.

## Commands

```bash
# Setup (first time)
./scripts/setup.sh                    # installs Bun, OpenClaw, dependencies, configures .env

# Start / Stop (daily use)
./scripts/start.sh                    # start OpenClaw + backend + desktop
./scripts/start.sh --no-desktop       # headless mode
./scripts/stop.sh                     # stop everything

# Development
cd callingclaw-backend && bun --hot run src/callingclaw.ts    # dev with hot reload
cd callingclaw-desktop && npm start -- --dev                  # dev with DevTools
cd callingclaw-backend && bun test                            # all tests
cd callingclaw-backend && bun test test/modules/voice.test.ts # single test

# Build DMG
cd callingclaw-desktop && xattr -cr . && npm run build

# Health check
curl http://localhost:4000/api/status
curl http://localhost:18789/healthz    # OpenClaw gateway
```

## Configuration

Single `.env` file at project root (symlinked into `callingclaw-backend/`). See `.env.example` for all options.

OpenClaw has its own config at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — manage it via `openclaw configure`.

## Architecture

```
callingclaw-backend/     Bun backend — AI orchestration, voice, meeting lifecycle
callingclaw-desktop/     Electron desktop app — UI, audio bridge, tray
# Website: github.com/XEasonChan/callingclaw-website (separate repo, Vercel)
```

### Backend: Module-Wired Pattern

All services instantiate once in `callingclaw.ts` and inject cross-module dependencies:

1. **Infrastructure** — NativeBridge (osascript+cliclick), SharedContext (central state), EventBus, TaskStore, GoogleCalendarClient
2. **Voice & AI** — VoiceModule (wraps RealtimeClient), VisionModule (Gemini Flash), ComputerUseModule (Haiku during meetings, Sonnet outside), ContextRetriever (Haiku gap detection)
3. **Meeting** — MeetingModule (recording+action items), MeetingScheduler (calendar auto-join), PostMeetingDelivery, KeyFrameStore
4. **Skills** — MeetingPrepSkill, OpenClawBridge (System 2 deep reasoning), BrowserActionLoop (Haiku + Playwright snapshot)
5. **Browser (Dual Chrome)** — Chrome #1: ChromeLauncher (Playwright library: Meet join + audio injection + admission monitor + screen share). Chrome #2: OpenCLIBridge (fault-isolated execution: deterministic web adapters, CLI hub, operate mode). See `docs/opencli-experiment-findings.md` for architecture decision.
6. **HTTP Server** — `config_server.ts` takes a `Services` interface, builds REST + WebSocket APIs via `Bun.serve()`

### Multi-Provider Voice (ai_gateway/)

`RealtimeClient` normalizes OpenAI Realtime API, Grok Voice, and Gemini 3.1 Flash Live behind a `RealtimeProviderConfig` interface. Each provider defines URL, headers, event name mapping, capabilities, and session builder. Gemini uses `GeminiProtocolAdapter` for structural protocol transform (envelope-based, not type-field). The `VoiceModule` wraps this with a state machine: `idle <-> listening <-> thinking <-> speaking` (with interruption handling that tracks "heard transcript" ratio).

**Gemini-specific constraints:**
- Audio input: `realtimeInput.audio` (not `.media` or `.mediaChunks`), 16kHz PCM16
- Audio output: 24kHz PCM16 (matches CallingClaw canonical rate, no upsampling needed)
- Setup: `systemInstruction` must be <100 chars when tools are present (silently hangs otherwise)
- Tool schemas: minimal format only (`{ type: "string" }`, no property descriptions)
- Session resumption: 15-min limit, auto-reconnect with handle
- WebSocket: must use `require("ws")` npm package (Bun's `import from "ws"` gives built-in shim that ignores proxy)

### 5-Layer Context Model

See `callingclaw-backend/CONTEXT-ENGINEERING.md` for full details. Critical constraint: **never use `session.update` mid-meeting** (causes audio breaks). Use `conversation.item.create` for all runtime context injection.

- **Layer 0** — Core identity (~250 tokens, set once via `session.update`)
- **Layer 1** — Tool definitions (in `session.update` tools array, never in prompt text)
- **Layer 2** — Mission context (<500 tokens, injected once via `conversation.item.create`)
- **Layer 3** — Live context (FIFO, ~3000 tokens max, incremental `conversation.item.create`)
- **Layer 4** — Conversation (~124K tokens, managed by Realtime API)

### Tool Definitions

`tool-definitions/index.ts` exports `buildAllTools(deps)` which collects tools from modular files (calendar-tools, meeting-tools, automation-tools, ai-tools). Each module returns `{ definitions, handler }`.

### EventBus

Event-driven integration hub (`modules/event-bus.ts`). Supports WebSocket subscribers, HTTP webhooks (HMAC-signed), and in-process listeners with glob patterns (e.g., `"meeting.*"`). Correlation IDs trace meeting lifecycle end-to-end.

### Desktop: Electron Dual-Process

- **Main process** (`main/index.js`) — DaemonSupervisor (spawns/manages Bun backend), PermissionChecker, window+tray management, IPC handlers
- **Renderer** (`renderer/index.html`, vanilla JS) — communicates with backend via HTTP/WS to localhost:4000
- **Preload** (`preload/index.js`) — contextBridge exposes `callingclaw.*` API
- **Audio Bridge** (`renderer/audio-bridge.js`) — AudioWorklet capture+playback with ring buffer. Two modes: `direct` (local mic/speaker) and `meet_bridge` (BlackHole routing)

### WebSocket Multiplexing

`config_server.ts` multiplexes three WS types on one port:
- `/ws/events` — EventBus real-time stream (Desktop UI updates)
- `/ws/voice-test` — Browser-based voice testing
- `/ws/audio-bridge` — Electron audio (AudioWorklet PCM chunks)

## Rules

- **Bun, not Node.js** for all backend work. Use `Bun.serve()`, `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.$` — see `callingclaw-backend/CLAUDE.md` for full Bun API guidance
- **Vanilla JS** in Electron renderer (no TypeScript in HTML files)
- **Audio format**: always 24kHz PCM16 mono across all audio paths
- **Context engineering**: follow the 5-layer model; never put tool definitions in prompt text
- `setSinkId()` must be called BEFORE `getUserMedia()` in Electron (bug #40704)
- Shared document directories live at `~/.callingclaw/shared/` (prep, notes — accessed by backend, desktop, and OpenClaw)
- User config: single `.env` file at project root (symlinked into backend)
- **DMG build**: output to `/tmp`, not iCloud — `build/afterPack.js` strips xattrs but iCloud re-adds them

## Known Gotchas

| Area | Gotcha | Burned When |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Desktop renderer** | NEVER use TypeScript syntax in index.html — P0 crash | v2.4.1, v2.6.2 |
| **DMG build** | iCloud resource forks → codesign fails. Build to `/tmp` | v2.7.10 |
| **Bundle ID** | Dev = `com.github.electron`, prod = `com.tanka.callingclaw`. TCC permissions don't carry between them | v2.7.10 |
| **Audio setSinkId** | Must be called BEFORE `getUserMedia()` (Electron bug #40704) | v2.5.0 |
| **Scheduler events** | Use `meeting.prep_ready` not `scheduler.prep_ready` — frontend only listens for the former | v2.7.8 |
| **MeetingScheduler dedup** | Must check existing sessions by meetUrl/calendarEventId before creating new ones | v2.7.9 |
| **BlackHole speaker** | If system default output = BlackHole, direct mode AI audio goes to virtual device | v2.7.10 |
| **getUserMedia + BlackHole** | Even virtual audio devices trigger macOS TCC mic permission — must be in checkAll() | v2.7.10 |
| **BlackHole macOS 26** | BlackHole 0.6.1 loopback is BROKEN on macOS 26 Tahoe (0 signal). Use Playwright addInitScript audio injection instead | v2.7.11 |
| **Meet audio receivers** | Meet creates 5+ audio receivers per PeerConnection, most are `muted=true` (silence). MUST select `track.muted===false` for the active speaker | v2.7.11 |
| **Worklet cross-origin** | AudioWorklet.addModule() from localhost fails inside Meet page (cross-origin). MUST use Blob URL inline worklet code | v2.7.11 |
| **Playwright CLI vs Library** | `playwright-cli` eval() cannot intercept getUserMedia (Meet caches at module load). MUST use Playwright library `addInitScript()` for pre-load injection | v2.7.11 |
| **Meet bot detection** | Playwright Chrome must use `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` + `ignoreDefaultArgs: ["--enable-automation"]` or Meet blocks joining | v2.7.11 |
| **Audio capture self-check** | After joining Meet, MUST verify captured audio has nonzero amplitude (maxAmp > 0). If all zeros, cycle through ALL receivers trying each for 5s — the unmuted receiver may appear later after join stabilizes. **FIXED v2.7.12**: setupCapture cycles receivers by index with triedReceiverIdx | v2.7.12 |
| **Playwright lib vs CLI coexistence** | `launchPersistentContext` holds Chrome process — playwright-cli CANNOT connect to same profile simultaneously. **FIXED v2.7.12**: ChromeLauncher.joinGoogleMeet() + admission monitor use Playwright library directly, playwright-cli bypassed for Meet join | v2.7.12 |
| **Admit monitor missing** | **FIXED v2.7.12**: Admission monitor ported to ChromeLauncher (startAdmissionMonitor, _admitEvalLib, onMeetingEnd). Uses page.evaluate() directly | v2.7.12 |
| **BlackHole in Chrome prefs** | Chrome profile saves last-used audio devices. If BlackHole was previously selected, Meet picks it on next launch → muted audio. ChromeLauncher.clearAudioDevicePrefs() resets to system default on every launch | v2.7.19 |
| **Screen share native dialog** | Chrome's screen picker dialog is NATIVE (not DOM), Playwright CANNOT click it. Use `--auto-select-desktop-capture-source=CallingClaw Presenting` flag to auto-select tab by title match. Set tab title via `document.title = "CallingClaw Presenting"` before sharing | v2.7.19 |
